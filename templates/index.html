                    <p class="about-paragraph">
                        A vegan lifestyle prevents a tremendous amount of animal slaughter and suffering. It offers a
                        potent way to shrink our environmental footprint, especially in regard to climate change. And a
                        well-planned vegan diet can fuel the highest levels of fitness, while reducing our risk of
                        various chronic diseases. Plus, the food is insanely delicious and it becomes more widely
                        available every year. Finding a large collection of vegan recipes without having to visit
                        many websites can be quite a challenge however, and this is why Veggie Planet was created, to
                        produce a large database of vegan recipes over time with the help of its users. As a visitor,
                        you can
                        use Veggie Planet to browse our entire database of recipes and look for inspiration, but you can
                        also
                        add your own recipes for the world to see and try out!

                                    More and more consumers are questioning the consumption of meat and the effects that
                                    our diets have on animals, the environment, and our health. This is also reflected
                                    in the increasing demand for meat alternatives. All well-known supermarkets now
                                    offer a wide range of plant-based burgers, sausages, and other meat substitutes,
                                    based on legumes, vegetables, cereals, and other ingredients. Meat alternatives
                                    offer several advantages compared to meat. Vegan versions of burgers, for example,
                                    are free of cholesterol and usually contain fewer calories and less fat than similar
                                    burgers made with meat.

                                    More and more consumers are questioning the consumption of cow’s milk and the
                                    effects that our diets have on cows, the environment, and our health. This is also
                                    reflected in the increasing demand for non-dairy milk. Plant milks have been
                                    consumed for centuries in various cultures, but their popularity has skyrocketed
                                    over the past decade. The range of healthy vegan milk alternatives for drinking,
                                    cooking, and baking is now huge. Some plant milks have sugar added to them, but
                                    unsweetened options are also available.

                                    Due to their foaming and binding properties, eggs are an important ingredient in
                                    many dishes, from baked goods and desserts to mayonnaise and hollandaise sauce.
                                    However, egg production is responsible for significant animal welfare issues,
                                    environmental damage, and health risks. ProVeg presents a range of healthy vegan egg
                                    alternatives for cooking and baking.
